**Adaptive LoFi generator.**\
A cross-platform, procedural LoFi generator that adapts your background audio in real-time. 

---

## Features

* **Procedural DSP** – Powered by `libpd`. Real-time Low-Pass filters and tape-wobble logic that work on Linux and Android.
* **Environment Aware** – 
    * **Linux:** Uses OpenCV to analyze room brightness and color temp.
    * **Android:** Uses the physical **Ambient Light Sensor** (ALS) 
* **Tiling-Aware (Hyprland)** – Deep integration with `hyprctl` to track active window classes and shift between audio profiles.
* **ASCII Visualizer** – A real-time video-to-ASCII aesthetic wrapper (optional/toggleable).
* **Privacy First** – Local-only processing. No snapshots saved, no telemetry, no cloud bullshit.
